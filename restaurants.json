        "text": "I recently had the opportunity to dine at Brown's Brewing in Troy, and I must say, the location is absolutely stunning. Overlooking the beautiful Hudson River, the restaurant offers both indoor and outdoor seating, making it a perfect spot for enjoying a meal with family and friends. The ambiance is inviting, and the seating arrangements are well thought out, providing a comfortable experience.\n\nNow, let's talk about the food and beer ‚Äì both were exceptional! The menu features a variety of delicious options that cater to different tastes, and the craft beers are some of the best I've had. It's clear that the kitchen and brewing team take pride in their offerings, and it truly enhances the dining experience.\n\nHowever, I did encounter some issues with the service that I feel compelled to mention. There seemed to be a lack of coordination between the reservation desk and the seating arrangements. Despite seeing several empty tables that were not reserved, we had to wait 45 minutes to be seated. This was frustrating, especially since it appeared that other guests who arrived after us were served much more quickly.\n\nWhile I want to emphasize that my experience may not reflect the restaurant as a whole, I did feel that the service was somewhat biased. Again, I want to clarify that I am not suggesting any intentional discrimination, but it was disheartening to witness a disparity in service. Regardless, I chose to leave a 20% tip because I wanted to focus on the positive aspects of the meal and leave with good memories.\n\nOverall, while the food and atmosphere at Brown's Brewing are fantastic, the service left something to be desired. Unfortunately, this experience has led me to decide that it will be my last visit. I hope they can address these issues in the future, as the potential for a great dining experience is certainly there.",

Indoors, they have a bar and dining area downstairs and more dining upstairs.  I had my engagement dinner and graduation dinner upstairs over in the past and it was great!\n\nLove their outdoor patio area as well. My husband and I came on a Friday evening but still got seated right away outside. We shared the artichoke dip, I had the Moroccan tuna and my hubby had the short rib tacos. 1 star was lost because surprisingly the Moroccan tuna was very bland. It was encrusted in sesame seeds and tasted like‚Ä¶. Nothing. I will admit I don‚Äôt know what Moroccan food is ‚Äúfamous‚Äù for or what to expect but I just imagined in my head something exotic, maybe a little spicy or something and I didn‚Äôt get that.\n\nWe‚Äôll definitely be back, I‚Äôll just skip the tuna next time.",

Staff was attentive, responsive and pleasant, food was excellent - guests were surprised it was more than basic bar food. We had a buffet and a 2 hour bar tab, worked very well to enable lots of mingling, but with seating for everyone, too. The atmosphere was just right, a combination of the social quality of a bar but still a private space. Highly recommend for events. Many thanks to Nicki for managing the event and to Jeff for attending to all of us.",

I had never been to the co op before so I wasn‚Äôt sure what other goods they had and I was so pleased to see that they had other baked goods that were ready to go and free of my children‚Äôs allergens. Needless to say, I will definitely be getting my baked goods from them from now on.",

Maybe she does it to others too, but there is a distinct attitude and rudeness that I have witnessed  that she feels she can get away with only with black customers. I notice a new vibe here after shopping here for years, and all I have to say it out with the old and in with the new. I don‚Äôt care how long you‚Äôve been there, if you cannot adjust to the demands of your position and the culture of your shoppers, you need to GO.\n\nAlso, the culture of this ‚Äúmember-owned‚Äù store is inherently problematic. Clearly workers are exploited and pressurized and it comes out in their interactions with customers, with supervisors glad to sit back and watch us snark at each other. It‚Äôs toxic.",

        "text": "It was my first time coming here and I absolutely amazing. I love the store, adored it even. Great selection and the staff were so kind  in contrast to what was said in other reviews but again, this was my experience. I like that this company gives back to the workers and community. I got the pleasure of being checked out by a really helpful and Informative woman that told me a little bit about what a co-op even was. The only thing I noticed, I wouldn't even call it a complaint is the prices. It's just something that maybe shopping here you should be aware of,  it is expensive, Even in contrast to other organic/healthfood stores that I've been to with similar set ups. I got a lot of produce and only produce and it came out to $45. I was  telling the lady that was checking me out in our chat, that we had a local store in my hometown of Kingston called mother Earth, and they're known to be pricey, but I realized after sh  told me my total , that even Mother Earth isnt expensive as here. I would've been able to get the same amount of produce for like $25. It's because the price per pound here is a noticeably more in my opinion. so a suggestion, if you're coming for something prepackaged like almond milk or something, you can get another store go to another store, but if you're coming for locally sourced food come here . Overall, I am grateful that I have a place to come to that reminds me of home and also has the same selection. I mean the the same spitting image selection as the local health food store I'm used to back home. They even had my favorite garlic cashews here. Overall, I'm really happy with my experience. So if you come here you def will be wowed by their selection cause they have a lot of nice things from multi vitamins, peanut butter you can hand press in store,   excellent produce, to local coffee, meat for my fellow carnivores and so much more. I sound like a spokes person but  It really has it all.",

We've finally discovered the BEST Italian restaurant in the Hudson Valley Region, and we've tried A LOT of them! Heck, every one I've tried after this just doesn't compare!\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious with large portions and very affordable. I'm salivating just thinking about it! I have serious food allergies and we were served by what seemed to be chef reassuring me that my food was made without any of the allergens I communicated to my waitress! What? I've never had someone go out of their way to make me feel comfortable eating my food without fear of anaphylaxis!\n\nAnd to top it all off, all the desserts were HOMEMADE and the quality showed through, when we thought the night couldn't have been more perfect, the bartender surprised us with a round of drinks on him! Wow! Anytime I'm in Albany I'll be making reservations!",

Started with Meiomi PInot Noir, bread with olive tapenade, oil and vinegar, and loaded arrincini.\n\nFor entrees, we ordered the Mahi Mahi special, seafood special and risotto, and scallops.  Everything is delicious.\n\nI'm not sure if Grappa 72 is on well known for desserts, but they should be.  Their Tira Misu is perfection, and even better is their strawberry, ricotta cheesecake, which has a lemon zest.  This work a double espresso is the perfect after dinner treat.\n\nMake a reservation today.  Excellent experience.",

I'm at City Beer Hall and ordered BluPizza's pepperoni pie. This crust is better than NYC!! I can tell real semolina is used and boy does it make a difference. Give it a try!! They have a Gorgonzola pie and I'm sorry now we didn't try that.  But next time for sure! 5 Star pizza!",

        "text": "A new adventure in brunching!!! Me and the girls were a little hungry so this was our choice.\n\nLocation is in a weird position so make sure u are a savvy parker if driving.\n\nWas not busy when we went which is always a plus for us. Decided to sit outside since it was warm but not blazing hot. Nice sized patio with gracious seating. There were large blocks to play with as well as corn hole making this family friendly as well as a have fun with ya friends place.\n\nWith a brunch entree you receive a complimentary Bloody Mary or Mimosa. The Bloody was HOUSE MADE which I could tell based on the spice level (one can tell horseradish over hot sauce!) and it was GOOD. So good I had two!! My daughter ordered I believe a peach bellini or a mimosa with pineapple juice but did get her complimentary one as well. Grand Princess was graced with a kiddie version - the first one the OJ was not good however the wonderful waitress we had fixed it right up for her and she enjoyed it!\n\nFor foods my daughter got the waffle breakfast sammy - BEC on a waffle drizzled (?) with some kind of syrup that was supposed to be a bit spicy I believe. She like it despite it being a little too sweet for her. I had an omelet that was very good. The bacon and sausage inside were tasty - was not a fan of these cheese. We ordered our meals as they were listed so we could try with no modifications. Grand Princess had a waffle with a side of bacon and was very happy.\n\nService was great. Atmosphere was a vibe. A place that we will return to.",

The food and drinks were absolutely devine.  The soup and Delmonico steak I ordered was bursting with flavor and they can surely whip up a fantastic cocktail. My server Scout was so sweet, friendly and attentive. The overall appearance of the restaurant is very elegant. I highly recommend checking this place out. I will definitely stop by again the next time I am in the area.",

The Manhattan chowder was not creamy but probably one of the best I've ever had. The muscles were light and flavorful. The Cornish game hen I had was superb and the pasta was excellent.

After the bread service, there was a long wait for the steak as it was cooked to perfection. (Which it was).\n\nJoseph brought over a complimentary sample of a pasta dish they had for my wife and I, it too was amazing and unexpected. but helped to make the night amazing.\n\nWhen the steak was brought over, joseph used a torch to blast the black truffle butter onto the steak and potatoes. The presentation was amazing!\n\nJoseph went out of his way to help explain dishes, drinks, and make our first year anniversary a memorable one.\n\nI highly recommend going here for a wonderful meal. The cost is high. but the food is worth it!\n\nMy wife and I cant wait to go again!",

He not only took my order over the phone in the most friendly manner (even with the short notice) They usually ask for 24 hour notice to make sure they have enough bread for the day but he was not mad or upset or made me feel bad about ordering on such short notice. He simply said no problem, took my order and even gave us more toppings for our staff to choose to add more options to the sandwiches. In todays world I fee customer service is tough to find. It was not the case here. Unbelievably nice. And when we picked up the order, the sandwiches were not only ready on time but looked amazing and he bagged them up for easy handling. I can not say enough goo things about this establishment. If you are in the Albany area this Subway has to be YOUR Subway!!!! THANK YOU so much the staff here really enjoyed everything.",

They have a nice palate. I was not wrong, the taste and sauces of the food were very good. I also tasted the pasta on my friend's plate, it was also very good. The atmosphere, relevance, and cleanliness are excellent. I also liked the automatic payment at the table. We did not have to call the waiter and wait. We paid ourselves and left. 5 stars ü§©",

The bread tasted like rubber and was very tough.  When I was checking out, I asked to put points on my rewards card.  I couldn't understand the workers accent, as he was mumbling.  He then proceed to get mad when I swiped my card twice because I had no clue what he wanted.  He kept saying put chip in when I was trying to pay with a gift card.  His attitude was uncalled for, and he was very rude and disrespectful.  I will never visit this Subway again.",

When ordering, the person serving (an Indian guy) refused serve some cheese and vegetables because we were supposed to order from left to right he would not go back to add some cheese. The guy also got mad at my two teenagers that were trying to order not following the guy's rules. It is the first time that we have to put up with this nonsense. So, my advice is to go to a more polite and service oriented Subway unless you are willing to pay for a low quality service.",

Like other reviewers have mentioned, the food arrives lukewarm, and the home fries certainly don't taste or look homemade. It feels like the restaurant is cutting too many corners while still charging for an 'experience' that doesn't deliver.\n\nOn the bright side, the staff is warm and does their best to be attentive, though they seem stretched thin due to understaffing.\n\nOne major concern is the bee issue on the patio. It‚Äôs disappointing that patrons are left to decide if they‚Äôre willing to \"take the risk\" to dine outside. This situation reflects a lack of responsibility on the part of the restaurant, where simple accountability could vastly improve the customer experience.",

I went all out with the Cheesesteak Omelette and Eggs Benedict ‚Äî and trust me, both dishes hit it out the park. The omelette was packed with tender steak and gooey cheese, cooked perfectly with every bite. The Eggs Benedict had the silkiest hollandaise, and that poached egg was chef‚Äôs kiss!\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a brunch spot that‚Äôll satisfy your soul and leave you thinking about breakfast all week, Caf√© Madison‚Äôs where it‚Äôs at. Pro tip: Get there early if you don‚Äôt wanna wait, but if you do, just know it‚Äôll be worth every second. üëåü•öüíØ",

The reason being that we love the staff and the great food!\n\nOne weekend they had a Taylor Swift themed weekend where they served her favorite dishes and played her music all weekend. It was so much fun, even for casual listeners of her music.\n\nThe food is amazing. We usually get omelettes or the standard breakfast. Sometimes we also order the special so we can try it out.\n\nFor drinks- We get a champagne dream (on recommendation of staff). We primarily come to the bar, where you can always find seating and great service. Drew (bartender, pictured serving his drink creations) has been amazing and has even been learning to make his own drinks. He has some incredible \"Drew Specials,\" such as a Clover Club with a raspberry twist (off-menu items, as shown in the first attached image) and a few others he's made for us (like the citrusy Chamomile Gin Fizz in 3rd image with the citrus rind, or the Blueberry Sunset in 4th and 5th images with red transitioning to a lighter color, and the raspberry cosmo in 6th image with the dark citrus slice).\n\nWe will continue to come here every weekend, as it's close to home and always has great food, drinks, and friendly staff.\n\nThank you, Cafe Madison, for always providing a great weekend brunch experience for me and my partner. We sincerely appreciate you!\n\n------\nOriginal:\nAlways a great place to go for brunch! Amazing drinks, great food, and awesome staff. Love the new location! So spacious and beautiful.\n\nThe California Avocado Omelette is always delicious. Peach Bellini, Champagne Dream, and seasonal drinks (like the Sunrise Mimosa and Apple Pie Mimosa) are always on point.\n\nMario C, Emily, Drew, and Sarah are a great servers (and Aki, and other staff were great, too) and looking forward to coming back next weekend!",

        "text": "In town on business and did some Yelping to see what was good in the area. I checked out this place and their menu then made the decision. Here's how it went...\n\nAtmosphere/Appearance: Right off of a city street is this gem. It's got a good mixture of a dive bar and a decent pub. They were in the middle or doing some renovations so I'm excited to see what the new interior looks like when they're all done! For now there's lots of darker woods all over along with a decent bar rail right near the front entrance. Along the back wall is a very long bench seat paired with tables that you can push together to form one long one. It's a college town so it was a bit loud inside, but you kind-of expect that from these types of bars.\n\nService: Katie took great care of us. She was so friendly, charismatic, funny and just overall brought an extra level of joy to our dining experience.\n\nFood: I saw wings on the menu so l went for it. They had a list of flavors with some interesting names. I went with the \"Brother Rob Hot\" which is supposed to be some super hot sauce, but it wasn't. It had a good amount of eat and great flavor, but it's nothing to be afraid of. Another flavor I got was the Buffalo Garlic Parmesan. It was delicious and my preferred sauce over the others. Next up was Medium. Medium was medium. I also got the chance to try their Honey BBQ which was a great deep, tangy flavor with natural-tasting sweetness. Last, but not least was the \"Sauce of the Day\" a sweet, tangy, honey-based selection. It was okay, but quite different. The wings were also big, juicy and not fried so much to where they were burnt. Their house-made bleu cheese was fantastic and went perfectly with the spiciness of the wings.\n\nValue: 20 big juicy wings with bleu cheese, celery and carrots will run you $28.00. Given the size of them and that I can get more than 1 FULL MEAL out of them makes them worth it for sure.\n\nI'd totally come back here specifically for the wings. It's a nice chill place to hang out with your friends or coworkers to get a beer, some food and take a load off for the day.",

The prices have climbed with the economy so your Wing Burger is a bit more but the food is good and still competitive with the locals.\n\nThey have a cute outdoor patio, fun keg urinals, and shuffle board to play in the back. Plenty of space to enjoy an after work happy hour and I even saw some decent NA brews for anyone needing to DD.\n\nThe decor keeps to the Ruck standards and the staff are still welcoming and friendly. Comfortable to enjoy if you are a regular or if you drop in from time to time.\n\nOn a bigger plus they allow your pups to join you which makes another pup friendly destination in Troy NY.\n\nThank youüòÅ",

The pho is not too salty nor overly flavorful, but it's just right to enjoy.\nThe vermicelli dish with pork is really huge with a nice Vietnamese flavor (lemongrass and a bit of fish sauce).\nI love this vermicelli dish!!\nIced coffee with condensed milk is awesome as well.\nHighly recommended!",

        "text": "I'm so upset this morning I decided to get breakfast for my co workers and walked in the staff was amazing and friendly I got a sandwich and bagels for my co workers and as I'm eating my sandwich I see pure green/blue in my sandwich i open it up and the egg is completely covered in mold! I almost puked the fact that another human being can willingly put that on another person's sandwich with I'll intent blows my mind. What is this world coming too. I couldn't even get a picture of the side that had the most mold on it I'm sick that I ate the other half. I hope the person that did this finds peace in their heart cause there's no way that they didn't see it putting it on the sandwich. So much evil in this world. The picture doesn't even do it justice what was shown and the other side that was already eaten was worse. The fact that someone deliberately wants to hurt someone and thinks that's okay to do has serious mental health problems and is a danger to society.\n\nUpdate i have reached out and no one has gotten back to me. Hence the review",

It was definitely NOT what we ordered but we didn‚Äôt have time to go through getting the order remade. Bagels were good, hard to judge the rest since it wasn‚Äôt what we ordered. We understand that they were busy but a little more care and actually listening when we told them what we had ordered and making sure that was what they gave us instead of just handing us whatever bag they found would have been appreciated. Not the best first experience with Bruegger‚Äôs. Might be our last.",

This particular location has the added convenience of a drive-through, which is a big plus. Like all its locations the coffee is horrible. I do wish they had some seating available, as it's always nice to have the option to sit and enjoy your meal. Despite that, the quality of the food and the drive-through convenience keep me coming back. Highly recommend!",

I waited for 40 minutes and still didn‚Äôt have my order ready. The workers are incredibly rude and don‚Äôt even give you the time to ask about it. Then they didn‚Äôt have the bagel I ordered and who knows, maybe they would have had it 40 minutes ago when I ordered it but rather than call ahead they just wait. And even when they do have it the bagels aren‚Äôt good. This place is awful I would recommend going to literally any other bagel place before this one.",

Probably would have walked out but only restaurant that was near hotel. Asked for medium rare burger and arrived more well done. Brioche bun grilled but soggy from too much butter added. Subbed French fries for mashed potatoes and they were left too long under heat lamp and had a film over them.\nFish and chips scored better. Fries crispy and two pieces of fish were small but crispy as well.\nWaitress kept disappearing so refill on drinks not an option or would have been there all night. I would understand if the place was packed with customers but it wasn‚Äôt.",

They think that because most of their clientele are SUNY Albany students that they can treat people however they want.

        "text": "Looking for a midnight snack, look no further because Dino Pizzeria opens really late for partygoers, street dwellers, or night owls. While most restaurants are closed, you can count on a reliable slice of pizza. Here at Dino Pizzeria, you can find all sorts of pizzas, ranging from regular cheese pizza to a buffalo wing (boneless of course) pizza. A good thing about this place is that the slices are bigger than you average slices and the price is pretty affordable. I sometimes come here a regular slice since I want to stay under budget, and for $2, you get a giant slice that fills any night dwellers stomachs. One problem I would say about this place is that it gets really stuffy at times, even with the door open, so it‚Äôs best if you grab and go. However, they have pretty decent pizzas and some stellar pizza and wings deals.",
